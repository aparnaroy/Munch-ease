With our new app, munch-ease, grocery shopping can be fun and efficient again! Being a college student can be stressful, and grocery shopping is just one more thing on your long and intimidating to-do list. Cut your grocery trips in half and manage your money spending with **munch-ease** all in one spot! We provide a weekly calendar for meal planning and make eating stress-free and cooking fun!

### Our app includes 4 main pages: 
* **Recipes:** lists out all recipes (pre-inputted recipes as well as recipes added by the user)
* **Add:** allows user to add their own custom recipe, the ingredients needed for it, and which day/s of the week they plan to make the recipe
* **Calendar:** a weekly view of the recipes the user plans to make/eat
* **Grocery List:** a list of all ingredients (with quanitities) needed for the week based on recipes added to the week by the user, the ingredients' prices, and the total price of all ingredients needed for the week   
    
*Note: some of the above described functionalities have not yet been implemented*
